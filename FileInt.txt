# Introduction

Decades of research show that immersion classrooms are a particularly effective way for children to achieve strong communicative proficiency in a second language (L2) that is not widely spoken in the community [@Lyster2019; @Genesee2006]. Nevertheless, children who participate in these programs do not uniformly attain L2 abilities identical to those who acquire the language of immersion (*i.e.*, the target language) as a first language (L1), despite beginning at a young age and having extensive L2 exposure over many years [@Lyster2019]. For these learners, who are taught mainstream instructional content using the target L2, gaps in L2 abilities are evident for both their lower morphosyntactic accuracy [@Kowal1997; @Lyster2007l] and their more limited range of vocabulary [@Harley1992]. The studies of the present dissertation were conducted to identify ways in which the English ability of immersion learners differ from other groups of English users, and to understand how these differences are connected to their L2 learning context. 

Research generally supports the common observation that children appear to have an advantage in L2 learning. Nevertheless, understanding of the impact of age on L2 acquisition has become more nuanced over time. Both adults and children can become highly proficient L2 users, but when compared with later starters, very young L2 learners living where the L2 is the majority language of a community (henceforth community-L2 learners) are much more likely to attain L2 abilities that more closely parallel L1 speakers of the target L2 [@Marinova2000; @Dekeyser2012]. In order to capitalize on the apparent ability of children to learn an L2 through authentic language use, and in response to the perceived limitations of traditional approaches to L2 instruction, early immersion programs in Canada and the US were founded on the assumption that children could rely on L2 input and their natural incidental language learning mechanisms to develop L1-like proficiency in an L2 [@Fortune2008; @Genesee1984]. Essentially, it was hoped that the success of community-L2 learners could be reproduced within immersion classrooms. Despite these expectations, research has consistently shown that children in immersion contexts have predictable differences in their L2 abilities when compared to L1 speakers of the target language. Immersion learners still achieve high levels of L2 communicative proficiency. However, why immersion learners continue to demonstrate non-target L2 abilities (*i.e.*, they continue to make errors) even after many years of L2 exposure is an important topic for basic L2 research, as well as immersion pedagogy, yet has remained under researched.

The overarching purpose of this dissertation is to examine how L2 abilities are impacted by learning in an immersion context. Though the common wisdom is that children are inherently and uniformly gifted at language learning, the evolving understanding of L2 acquisition in children indicates that building L2 proficiency is not the effortless, rapid process that it is sometimes believed to be [@Paradis2019]. Research over the last decade in community-L2 contexts increasingly shows that differences in either cognitive ability or L2 experiences can influence the L2 development of individual learners [@Paradis2011g; @Chondrogianni2018]. Learning an L2 either within an immersion context, where the language is not widely spoken in the community, or in a community-L2 context is certain to impact the the type and frequency of experiences that learners have with the L2. Though these differences are expected to impact L2 abilities, it is currently unclear the extent to which immersion learners' non-target L2 ability are unique to immersion contexts or are shared by other early high-proficiency L2 learners. Where other potential impacting factors are held constant, differences in L2 abilities between groups should be considered evidence of the impact of L2 context. However, due to the lack of direct comparisons between immersion learners and their community-L2 peers, there is little previously collected empirical data to address this issue.

In examining the impact of context, the present dissertation aims to address gaps where there is a lack of research in immersion. The first gap is that little is known about how immersion learners compare to other young high proficiency L2 learners. Within the following studies, the L2-English immersion participants are compared to both L1-English speakers and community-L2 learners of English. While both comparison groups have value, community-L2 learners are also bilinguals and as such, are similar to the immersion learners in having the influence of co-existing and interacting languages [@Grosjean2008]. Thus, for the goal of understanding how the immersion context impacts L2 acquisition, community-L2 learners are a particularly valuable comparison group. The second gap in immersion research is that little is known about how L1-Mandarin speakers acquire L2 English in immersion. Most research for immersion contexts has examined the language pairings of L1 English and L2 French, or L1 English and L2 Spanish. Despite the interest that L2-English learners who speak Mandarin as their L1 have received for other contexts, little research has examined this pairing of typologically distinct languages in immersion. The third addressed gap is the lack of immersion research on L2 receptive abilities. Studies often conclude that immersion learners are less target-like in their L2 production than for their receptive abilities [*e.g.*, @Genesee1987; @Turnbull2001; @Swain1982lapkin; @Knell2007; @Lindholm2011]. However, the receptive abilities of immersion learners have typically been assessed using holistic language assessments rather than tasks targeting specific L2 constructions, meaning that less is known about the receptive L2 abilities of immersion learners at a more fine-grained level.

While the key focus of the dissertation is on morphosyntactic knowledge in the form of English grammatical morphemes, receptive vocabulary ability is also examined. In examining how groups differ in their L2 abilities, L2 learning context is conceived as a macro-variable indexing a range of more proximal micro-variables that more directly impact L2 development. Micro-variables include sources of L2 experience like opportunities to use the L2 with peers or at home, as well as access to forms of media in the L2, all of which are expected to correlate with whether or not learners reside in a community where the L2 is widely used. The dissertation concludes with a discussion of how L2 abilities differ by context; factors that do or do not impact differences in L2 ability; why these differences in ability emerge; why they can persist; and finally, how these findings might inform immersion pedagogy.

# Research on Immersion

Broadly, language immersion is an educational approach in which children are required to use an L2 in order to learn new content (L2 is used throughout to denote any additional language begun in the preschool years or after). Programs that share this feature may also be referred to as *bilingual education*, or *content and language integrated learning* [CLIL, @Cenoz2014]. Students typically begin with an immersion program with similar, limited levels of L2 proficiency [@Swain1997]. These programs are designed to foster additive bilingualism through use of the L2 as the medium of instruction [@Swain1997; @Fortune2011]. Because the L2 is one not widely spoken in the community, it is considered characteristic of immersion that L2 experience is largely confined to the classroom [@Swain1997; @Ballinger2017b]. However, this does not preclude individual students from having meaningful L2 exposure outside of the classroom. Immersion programs can have a range of starting points and are correspondingly termed *early* for those that start within the preschool to first grade age range, *middle* for those who begin in the middle of primary school (approximately fourth grade of a K-12 system), and *late*, generally a seventh-grade start. For the present dissertation, the focus is early start immersion learners.

@Cummins1991 estimated that by the end of the 1980s, it was likely that more than a thousand empirical studies on language immersion had been done on Canadian French immersion alone. This research on Canadian French immersion played an important role in the modern popularity of the approach, as these studies provided a wealth of compelling evidence that, in addition to fostering strong L2 skills, participation in these programs did not negatively impact academic achievement or L1 abilities [@Genesee1987; @Turnbull2001; @Swain1982lapkin; @Harley1986]. Parallel findings outside of Canadian French immersion reinforce the value of the immersion approach for establishing language skills in an L2 while also supporting the L1 abilities and academic achievement [@Knell2007; @Cheng2010; @Alanis2000; @Cazabon1998; @Lindholm2011].

Language immersion classrooms are now found worldwide [@Fortune2011], including East Asia where there is a large and increasing demand for early English-immersion programs [@Lin2016]. In Canada, French immersion emerged from the St. Lambert 'experiment' when in the early 1960s, a parents' group pushed for an educational alternative that would more effectively meet the language needs of an Anglophone minority in a suburb of a French-English bilingual city in the French-majority province of Quebec [@Tucker2008]. Similar concerns about the effectiveness of traditional L2 instruction have made immersion an increasingly sought-after option in Mainland China [@Gao2017wang; @Cheng2012]. For these contexts, research documenting the academic outcomes of Chinese children in early English immersion programs concludes that these programs can be similarly effective to Canadian French immersion, with learners obtaining strong communicative ability in English, without negative impacts to L1 skills or academic performance [@Cheng2010; @Knell2007; @Cheng2012; @Qiang2011], though research on these contexts is still fairly limited [@Xiong2018]. 

Though the cited research indicates that L1-Mandarin students can develop L2-English proficiency without compromising L1 or academic abilities, conclusions about L2 abilities are based on holistic assessments. The bulk of immersion research has prioritized assessment of language, literacy, and academic skills in students' L1 rather than the L2, with fewer studies specifically on L2 development [@Hermanto2012]. This research focus is understandable given that few parents would be likely to opt for an L2 program that left students at a disadvantage for other essential abilities. Thus, despite the number of studies done on immersion contexts, few offer fine-grained information about L2 abilities and this is especially true for receptive ability. In contrast to either L1-Mandarin adult or community-L2 child learners, the specific L2-English abilities that L1-Mandarin immersion learners develop is essentially unresearched.

Early on, @Genesee1978id noted that immersion research tended to be evaluations of programs rather than evaluations of individual learners and the L2 abilities that each acquires. Specifically, @Genesee1978id noted the lack of studies on variations between individual immersion learners in the early wave of immersion research, stating that it was a missed opportunity to extract a deeper understanding of the process of L2 learning. The importance of identifying factors that mediate immersion learners' L2 proficiency was reiterated in the early 1990s [@Lapkin1990]. Nevertheless, contemporary research on differences between learners in immersion contexts has largely been limited to the development of L2 reading skills [*e.g.*, @Erdos2011; @Jared2011; @Li2012kirby]. Some research exists for the impact of learners' cognitive abilities at the early stages of L2 vocabulary development [*e.g.*, @Nicolay2013; @Woumans2019]. However, much less research exists for sources of individual differences in vocabulary or morphosyntax abilities at later stages.

## Acquisition of L2 Morphosyntax in Immersion Contexts

Though it is commonly believed that children are inherently and uniformly gifted at learning an additional language, and despite the effectiveness of immersion classrooms, the L2 abilities learners develop in these programs are not identical to those of L1 speakers, particularly for morphosyntactic accuracy [@Cummins2009; @Swain1982lapkin; @Lyster2019].  Specifically for Canadian French immersion, learners typically have persistent non-target use of constructions even when they are frequent in the L2 input, such as grammatical gender, articles, and verbs [@Allen1990]. In early-start programs, these learners begin receiving large amounts of L2 input in the year they turn five years old and typically amass 6000 hours of L2 exposure by the end of eighth grade [@Turnbull1998]. These learners quickly outpace peers with traditional L2 instruction and can perform on par with L1-French peers on tests of listening comprehension by eighth grade [@Swain1982lapkin]. Though L2 communicative ability remains high, non-target morphosyntactic ability typically endures into the final years of the immersion program [@Wesche1993; @Turnbull1998; @Harley1997]. Studies outside of French immersion have come to parallel conclusions about the morphosyntactic ability of learners. Research on immersion contexts involving languages as varied as Cherokee [@Peter2011], Irish [@Oduibhir2011], and Spanish [@Herschensohn2005] document challenges learners have with attaining morphosyntactic accuracy.

In accounting for non-target morphosyntactic ability, immersion researchers propose that acquisition is tied to the specific L2 experience learners have within their classrooms [*e.g.*, @Harley1990chapt; @Lyster2008]. Though immersion learners receive large amounts of L2 exposure, it is considered characteristic of this context that exposure is limited to the classroom [@Swain1997]. This means that learners get a lot of exposure to an academic register of the L2, but very little to informal speech that would be used among peers [@Tarone1995]. This pattern of using the L2 within the classroom, but the L1 for social interaction outside the classroom has been found to be characteristic of a wide variety of immersion programs around the world [@Ballinger2017b]. 

The limitation in sociolinguistic variation in the input can have implications for the frequency of morphosyntactic constructions experienced [@Peter2008; @Lyster2007l]. For example, French immersion learners have been found to overuse the informal second-person singular form 'tu' in contexts where the formal 'vous' would be more appropriate, and this has been linked to the infrequency of the sociolinguistic function of 'vous' in classroom input [@Swain1987]. In contrast, instances of 'vous' as a marker of second-person plural are common in the input and immersion learners generally use it correctly. Because classroom input is not always representative of language use in a French majority community, this lack of exposure to a particular form-function mapping can result in non-target L2 use [@Swain1990]. <!-- Do I want an explicit link between this sociolinguistic example and morphosyntax. Yes, but how? -->

Sociolinguistic context can also have implications more directly on morphosyntax and may explain some of the difficulty that Canadian French immersion learners' experience with L2 verb forms. Studies examining the distribution of verbs that French immersion teachers produce for their students from grades three to six have shown input can be heavily skewed toward present and imperative forms with past, future, and conditional being much less frequent [@Harley1987; @Izquierdo2007]. It has been proposed that the bias toward present and imperative forms is likely to impact verb form accuracy. Specifically for conditional forms, such as in response to a question like *Qu'est-ce que tu ferais si tu avais beaucoup d'argent?* 'What would you do if you had a lot of money?' immersion learners in tenth grade only used a correct conditional verb form in 56% of responses, whereas L1-French tenth grade students produced an accurate conditional form in 98% of responses, and even the L1-French first graders were able to use a conditional form in 95% of responses [@Harley1984Swain]. @Swain1988 pointed out that it is likely that immersion learners are never exposed to many verbs in less frequent forms like the conditional even into the later stages of immersion. Thus, she proposed 'restricted input' as a partial explanation for inaccurate verb marking with less frequent forms. 

Naturally, if a particular morphosyntactic constructions are rare or non-existent in the L2 input provided to immersion learners, they are unlikely to be acquired. However, non-target ability is still observed in the upper grades for Canadian French immersion for the highly frequent verbs [être]{.smallcaps} and [avoir]{.smallcaps}, and gender marking [@Harley1993]. By this point of their programs, these learners will have experienced thousands of hours of L2 input [@Turnbull1998], and should not be lacking in accurate exemplars of these L2 constructions. In explaining these discrepancies, @Harley1993 suggests that immersion learners misinterpret the L2 input that they hear in terms of linguistic knowledge that they already possess. Harley also points out that this type of L1 influence is not the explanation on its own, as these misinterpretations do not happen for all morphosyntactic differences. Vulnerable constructions are those that are irregular, lack perceptual salience, or do not carry a heavy communicative load.

As @Harley1993 indicates, L1 can have an important influence on L2 development in an immersion context, and in many cases these can be traced to specific properties of learners' L1. Previous research with L1-Mandarin community-L2 English learners indicates that grammatical morphology can be slowly acquired with differences potentially evident even after many years [*e.g.*, @Jia2007; @Paradis2011g; @Paradis2016a]. Given the evidence that immersion learners' acquisition of L2 morphosyntax can be subject to non-target ability, it should be predicted that these L2-English constructions are particularly vulnerable for these learners. Currently, however, the L2 morphosyntactic ability of L1-Mandarin speakers in L2-English immersion is under researched.

## Acquisition of L2 Vocabulary in Immersion Contexts

<!--         -   ID research? Nicolay2013 Woumans2019 all early no comparison group.  -->

In addition to non-target morphosyntactic ability, previous research has shown that immersion learners lag behind monolinguals in their knowledge of L2 vocabulary, though they establish larger L2 vocabularies than peers in traditional L2 instruction [@Harley1999jean]. Early French immersion students in second and fifth grade (their third or sixth years of immersion, respectively) have been shown to score more than one standard deviation below the criterion score on a monolingual-normed standardized test of French receptive vocabulary [@Hermanto2012]. Comparison of scores across the two cross-sectional time points suggests that learners in this context were not closing the receptive vocabulary gap between them and monolinguals. As compared to L1-French speaking peers, sixth grade immersion learners have lower lexical richness in their L2-French writing, avoiding use of French verbs with meanings incongruous with English counterparts and making proportionally greater use of high-frequency verbs [@Harley1989king]. This latter strategy of resorting to words with more general meanings where L1 speakers would use a more exact term is observed in immersion learners' oral abilities throughout their programs and is likely used to compensate for more limited vocabulary knowledge [@Harley1992]. However, this strategy is not unique to immersion learners as it has also been observed for community-L2 learners in their first few years of L2 exposure [@Golberg2008].

For immersion learners, the benefit of more years of immersion on vocabulary knowledge is evident in the early stages of immersion [@Nicolay2013; @Kalia2018; @Harley1999jean], but, like community-L2 learners, rapid early vocabulary development appears to eventually slow down [@Soto-Corominas2020]. When compared to early immersion learners, late-start learners (*i.e.*, those who start in seventh grade, rather than kindergarten) begin to catch up to early-start peers by tenth grade [@Harley1999jean]. However, the impact of more exposure may depend on the measure of vocabulary used, as findings for eleventh grade learners showed that early learners were significantly more able to identify words in the L2 than their late starting peers [@Harley1997]. 

In contrast, research shows that community-L2 learners are steadily catching up with monolinguals [@Golberg2008; @Farnia2011] and potentially meet or exceed the PPVT mean standard score around four to six years of L2 exposure [@Paradis2017]. Research with community-L2 learners also shows that the child's L1-L2 pairing matters with more similarity between the languages providing a benefit to L2 receptive vocabulary development [@Goriot2018; @Blom2020]. For L2 vocabulary learning in general, learning a language with a large number of cognates can facilitate acquisition [@Willis2012; @Degroot2000]. This can also benefit the acquisition of grammatical morphology as learners can analyze unknown morphemes on known words such as learning the bound progressive morpheme by comparing English *us-ing* with Spanish *us-ando* [@August2005]. However, in contrast to languages with greater historical and geographical links, Mandarin and English share very few cognates, and thus learners with this language pairing are less likely to benefit from this type of lexical overlap [@Sheng2016lam]. The research discussed above for vocabulary acquisition in an immersion context involves pairings of European languages, and mostly L1 English to L2 French. Thus, it is unclear how these findings generalize to more typologically distant languages that share few cognates. Like ability with L2 morphosyntax, little is known about the L2 vocabulary ability of L1-Mandarin, L2-English immersion learners.

# Non-target Comprehension Vs. Production

For L2 morphosyntax, the exact nature of how immersion learners' L2 ability may be non-target remains unclear. Within the literature on language immersion classrooms, the assertion that students have superior proficiency in receptive language ability (*i.e.*, listening or reading comprehension) as compared to productive ability (*i.e.*, speaking or writing) is often made [*e.g.*, @Cummins1998; @Kowal1997; @Lyster2007l]. On one level, this assertion may simply mean that immersion learners are more easily identified as L2 speakers by their language production rather than their language comprehension, a conclusion well-supported by evidence. On the other hand, this assertion may reflect a belief that there is an asymmetry between immersion learners' receptive and productive linguistic abilities. While a cursory review of the literature may appear to support an asymmetry, the findings may also be explained by the methodology used to examine either receptive or productive ability. To assess receptive ability, immersion studies typically use measures such as general listening or text comprehension that assess comprehension on a holistic level. In contrast to holistic comprehension measures, production is often evaluated using targeted tasks such as elicitation, sentence repetition, or detailed error analysis from oral interview transcriptions [*e.g.*, @Bild1989; @Turnbull1998; @Harley1997; @Harley1990chapt; @Day1987; @Thomas2014]. For educational research, holistic assessment tasks will often be superior for evaluating comprehension skills relevant for academic success, but these give little specific information about L2 morphosyntactic ability, or the mechanisms that contributed to morphosyntactic development. Currently, however, there is little research that has given immersion learners' receptive L2 morphosyntactic ability the same scrutiny as productive ability. 

Though holistic methods have predominated in assessment of immersion learners' receptive L2 abilities, one notable exception is @Lew-W2017. This study reported three separate eye-tracking experiments with L1-English participants in Spanish two-way immersion. The experiments measured participants' ability to identify upcoming nouns using either Spanish determiners with abstract grammatical gender; grammatical gender that coincided with the notional gender of the noun (*e.g.*, the Spanish translations of 'the man' or 'the woman'); or number information. Results for both six- and ten-year-old immersion participants were compared to their respective L1-Spanish classmates. The L2-Spanish participants in fourth or fifth grade, like L1-Spanish peers, were able to use notional gender and number-marked determiners to identify referents, and six-year-old L2 participants already demonstrated the ability to interpret number-marked determiners. However, unlike their L1-Spanish peers, neither L2 age group could not use grammatical gender this way, suggesting that the acquisition of these immersion learners was similar to late L2 learners, who also often demonstrate a similar inability to use gender information [@Lew-W2010; @Hopp2013b; @Gruter2012]. The results of @Lew-W2017 indicate that when receptive ability with specific L2 constructions is examined closely, L2 ability can also be non-target. However, the topic of immersion learners' receptive L2 abilities including either how they perceive or interpret L2 input remains under researched.

# Comparison of Grammatical Morphology in Mandarin and English

<!-- 4.  Across Language Comparison -->
<!--     -   Written, but cut down -->
<!--     -   Integrate some previous community-L2 research. -->
<!-- Conclude with the lack of morphosyntactic studies in English-Mandarin immersion? -->

Even for early L2 learners in community-L2 contexts, L1 can have an impact on acquisition of morphosyntax [@Blom2012; @Mcdonald2000; @Paradis2011g], and L1-L2 differences are implicated for immersion learners as well [@Lew-W2017; @Harley1993]. Differences in morphosyntax between L1 and L2 are particularly relevant to the present dissertation because the two languages involved, Mandarin as an L1 and English as an L2, are typologically distinct. Despite their frequently emphasized differences, Mandarin and English share some key morphosyntactic similarities. For example, Mandarin, like English, has fairly rigid word order, generally following *subject-verb-object* order, and both languages use head-final noun phrases [@Li1990maling]. Despite these similarities, this dissertation focuses on linguistic constructions that are less likely to benefit from transferred L1 knowledge and would have to be learned anew within the immersion context. As such, the constructions were not selected to give a general survey of immersion learners' L2 English morphosyntactic ability, but rather are biased toward constructions that are more likely to be impacted by L1-L2 differences.

Currently, there are numerous studies in the L2 acquisition literature focusing on how L1-Mandarin/Chinese speakers acquire L2-English constructions that are absent in the L1 [*e.g.*, @Jia2007; @Jiang2007; @Luk2009; @Paradis2016a; @Trenkic2014]. A particular contrast between the two languages is in the forms and functions of grammatical morphemes. Specifically, Mandarin lacks bound inflectional morphemes, and thus verbs are not inflected for tense/aspect or for subject agreement, nor are nouns inflected as either singular or plural [@Li2018thompson]. In addition, where English uses a free grammatical morpheme to mark definiteness on nouns, Mandarin uses word order (*i.e.*, syntax rather than morphology) with definite/specific nouns coming before verbs [@Li1989]. Thus, Mandarin and English have fundamental differences in the forms that grammatical morphemes take. For speakers of L1s like Mandarin or Vietnamese, these differences have been implicated as a factor that impacts community-L2 learners' acquisition of L2 English [@Mcdonald2000; @Blom2012].

In addition to cross-linguistic differences in the forms that grammatical morphemes take, the two languages also have key differences in the linguistic functions these constructions have. Of particular relevance to the present dissertation, the languages differ in both how and when nouns are marked for number. Like many other grammatical morphemes in English, plural-singular marking is not a construction that can be transferred from Mandarin [@Li1989; @Cheng1999; @Li1999], and thus needs to be learned through immersion exposure. Nouns can be quantified in both languages, but a key difference is that marking number is non-optional for English count nouns [@Corbett2000]. In contrast, nouns unmarked for number are very common in typical Mandarin usage [@Li1989; @Cheng1999; @Li1999], and thus, can be considered to have *general number* [@Corbett2000; @Rullman2006] meaning that, unlike English, they can be expressed without reference to number and are thus ambiguous in this regard when used outside of a discourse context. The lack of obligatory number marking in Mandarin can be seen in the two potential glosses of Example XX1_ex.

XX1_ex

1. 狗有尾巴
    - *gǒu yǒu wěibā*
    - dog have tail
    - 'The dogs have tails' or 'The dog has a tail'

While Mandarin has a morpheme '*-men*' that can follow pronouns and some common nouns referring to humans [@Li1999], it lacks the extensive productivity of the bound ‘*-s*’ in English. Productive ways of making explicit reference to a single item or multiple items are classifier constructions taking the form [numeral + classifier + noun]{.smallcaps} with the noun taking no bound morphology, meaning the head noun is the same whether the numeral is *one*, *two* or *twenty*. Demonstratives can also be combined with classifiers to form words equivalent to *this* and *these* in English. In addition, Mandarin has a small number of nouns that can appear directly after a numeral without a classifier (*e.g.*, 一天 [yī tiān], 'one day'). A classifier construction for a count noun is given in Example XX2_ex. ([cl]{.smallcaps} denotes a classifier.)

Again, however, while a classifier construction can disambiguate the number of items to which reference is made, it is not required for a noun to be interpreted as denoting either one or many. As a result of this crosslinguistic difference, Mandarin-speaking L2-English learners have to learn to consistently mark this contrast in production and monitor for it in comprehension. 

However, in comparison to other grammatical morphemes, there are reasons that suggest plural-singular marking should not be overly difficult to acquire. First, in L1 acquisition of English, plural '*-s*' is one of the earliest grammatical morphemes produced consistently by children learning English as an L1 [@Brown1973; @DeVilliers1973], and generally approaches adult-like mastery around seven years of age [@Berko1958; @Graves1971]. Second, plural-singular marking is semantically transparent, as the singular and plural forms denote what should be a salient observable difference in number. In contrast, grammatical gender's lack of a semantically transparent function has been argued to be a potential obstacle to acquisition in immersion [@Lew-W2017; @Harley1993]. If semantic transparency makes a difference, then plural-singular marking should be comparatively easier to acquire. Third, plural-singular marking in English is highly frequent as its use is non-optional on count nouns. It cannot always be assumed that even adult L1 speakers will attain completely consistent comprehension for all morphosyntactic constructions [@Dabrowska2018]. However, for plural-singular marking, research indicates that attaining a target threshold of accurate use is not unrealistic for L2 speaking children. 

Despite reasons to expect immersion learners should be able to acquire English plural-singular marking, the construction has been proposed as a potentially problematic one for Mandarin speakers, and speakers of other classifier languages [@Jiang2007; @Luk2009]. Further, evidence indicates that in the early stage of L2 English acquisition, preschool-aged community-L2 learners whose L1 is Chinese lag behind speakers of other L1s and English monolingual children for comprehension of plural-singular marking [@Xu2016]. In addition, longitudinal research shows L1-Mandarin children and adolescents can still produce English plural-singular marking variably even after five years of exposure [@Jia2003a]. This typological difference with English is shared by both Korean [@Kwon2004] and Japanese [@Nakanishi2004], which both also use classifiers to optionally mark number on nouns. For children with these L1s who are learning English in community-L2 contexts, production of plural '*-s*' appears to come later in L2 English than in L1 English relative to other grammatical morphemes [@Hakuta1976; @Shin1999]. Given that acquisition of morphosyntax in general is regarded as a weakness for immersion learners [@Harley1990chapt] and evidence that this construction may be impacted by L1-L2 differences, it is unclear whether the immersion participants will show target-like comprehension of English plural-singular marking.

# Individual Differences in Language Ability

A fundamental premise of this dissertation is that the specific L2 experiences immersion learners have within their learning context impact their L2 acquisition. Previous immersion research has drawn a connection between L2 ability and the language experiences that immersion learners have in school and their lack of experiences outside of school [*e.g.*, @Cummins2009; @Lyster2008; @Tarone1995; @Swain1987]. However, because little is known about how the L2 abilities of these learners compare to other high-proficiency L2 learners, it is unclear the degree to which non-target L2 ability is the result of experiential factors associated with the immersion context, or to L2 acquisition or bilingualism more generally.

A clearer understanding of how the language experience of immersion learners impacts L2 ability is relevant to contemporary research on language acquisition. In contradiction to previous approaches to language acquisition that emphasized the rapid and universal development of linguistic ability, accumulating evidence shows that the process is not as rapid, uniform, or effortless in either an L1 or L2 as previously believed. Individual differences in rate of L1 development can result from variations in cognitive ability [@Kidd2020] or differences in language exposure [@Walker2020; @Huttenlocher2010]. In adulthood, an individual's ability with L1 morphosyntactic constructions can vary based on both cognitive and language exposure variables [@Dabrowska2018]. For children exposed to multiple languages, the situation further complicates as language experience is divided between multiple languages within often vastly different learning contexts. In community-L2 contexts, L2 input factors like the proficiency of interlocutors or the balance of input between the languages impact development [@Hoff2020a; @Paradis2017]. Despite the expectation that the ultimate attainment of community-L2 learners will closely parallel the linguistic abilities of L1 speakers, research shows that even the attainment of these early learners can depend on language learning aptitude [@Abraham2009]; the learner's L1 [@Mcdonald2000]; and/or type of L2 experience [@Flege1999]. The emerging picture is that, in either an L1 or L2, language ability is sensitive to a multitude of factors. 

Research on early community-L2 learners has sought to identify influential factors in order to better understand the processes and mechanisms underlying L2 acquisition [@Paradis2011g; @Chondrogianni2018]. This research often groups impacting factors as either learner-internal or learner-external [*e.g.*, @Chondrogianni2011; @Paradis2011g; @PRSDG; @Sorenson2020]. Internal factors include cognitive abilities like memory or analytical skills, or accumulated/entrenched L1 knowledge. External factors are ones that influence the quality and quantity of an individual's L2 input and experiences, and can include such things as the frequency of L2 use at home among parents or siblings, language use with peers, or access to media in the L2. The extent to which these external factors contribute to a richer L2 environment should be expected to correlate strongly with an individual's L2 learning context.

While neither community-L2 nor immersion learners should be expected to exactly match L1 speakers for target language ability, the survey of research included in previous sections supports the expectation that the degree of difference in L2 ability is typically greater for immersion learners than for age-matched community-L2 peers. When other variables are held constant, differences in L2 ability between these groups of learners should be traceable to differences in their specific L2 experiences. This means it is not context directly that impacts L2 ability, but rather more proximal factors that mediate between context and L2 ability. For example, studies have shown that community-L2 learning children benefit from using the L2 with peers [@Carhill2008; @Soto-Corominas2020; @Paradis2017]. It is likely that these opportunities to use the L2 would also benefit immersion learners. However, in immersion contexts, access to peers who speak the L2 outside of school should be limited, and therefore, immersion learners will not benefit from peer L2 use to the same extent as community-L2 learners. It is expected that ultimately it is factors such as peer L2 use and other similar experiential factors that explain differences in L2 ability across contexts. Community-L2 and immersion comparisons are potentially valuable in revealing not only factors that impact L2 acquisition, but also how they impact this process.

To date, there have been very few studies in immersion contexts that have examined the impacts of learner factors and how these can result in individual differences in L2 abilities. In addition, existing studies have generally focused on learner-internal differences. For vocabulary, higher rates of vocabulary acquisition have been shown for those with higher verbal memory scores and better cognitive flexibility [@Nicolay2013], as well as better inhibitory control [@Woumans2019]. For immersion learners with many more years of exposure, language aptitude abilities reflecting better memory for text predict L2 vocabulary recognition [@Harley1997]. Factors that impact immersion learners' general L2 proficiency and/or comprehension include learner-internal factors like nonverbal reasoning [@Genesee1980], intelligence [@Genesee1976int], receptive vocabulary [@Vandergrift2015; @Vandergrift2018], and phonological awareness [@Li2012cheng]. Similarly, listening comprehension has been shown to benefit from measures of language aptitude reflecting better memory ability and language analytic skills [@Harley1997]. In addition, the learner-external factor of greater L2 use with acquaintances/peers can impact general L2 proficiency [@Hamayan1977].

# Basic Linguistic Research and Immersion Contexts

In contrast to what is typical for research on immersion, the purpose of this dissertation is not motivated directly by improving immersion pedagogy, but rather to contribute to a better understanding of the process of L2 acquisition in immersion and other L2 learning contexts in general. Research in immersion has made multiple compelling contributions to the field of L2 research [see @Swain2000a for a review]. Probably the most significant of these contributions has been demonstrating that L2 input alone is insufficient for development of completely target-like L2 ability particularly for morphosyntactic accuracy in language production [@Lyster2014; @Swain1995]. Nevertheless, the value of immersion contexts in examining and informing research on the processes and mechanism of L2 acquisition has largely been under appreciated. Though research for a single L2 context cannot be immediately generalized beyond that context, there are several reasons that immersion learners are particularly valuable to understanding how L2 proficiency develops.

Immersion contexts create high proficiency L2 speakers within a more controlled environment than that of other L2 learners [@Swain2000a]. Learners within a single immersion program generally have the same starting age, cumulative L2 exposure, current L2 exposure, L1-L2 pairing, and are not typically self-selected, meaning that the decision to enrol undertake L2 study is not their own. Much more is known about the L2 exposure background of immersion learners than for other groups of high proficiency L2 learners, such as community-L2 learners who have extensive and diverse exposure outside their classrooms as they learn the majority language of their community [@Paradis2017]. This is especially true in comparison to L2 participants recruited from undergraduate participant pools where details about prior L2 exposure beyond age of beginning are often undocumented, obscuring potentially important differences reflecting the diversity of life/learning experiences these L2 learners have with the L2. It is important that these sources of variation are known and it is in these immersion contexts where variables of language experience are most easily documented and potentially manipulated. Essentially, immersion contexts are likely as close to 'laboratory' conditions as L2 research can ethically come.

# Theoretical Framework

As stated, the main purpose of this dissertation is to examine how the immersion context impacts L2 acquisition. In order to investigate this topic, empirical evidence is gathered from an under researched immersion context. As valuable as this type of evidence can potentially be, its value is diminished if it cannot be cohesively integrated within a theoretical framework. At some level, all theories must link L2 experience with L2 ability. However, this connection is vital to usage-based theories where L2 acquisition is driven by input and experience [@Wulff2018]. From a usage-based approach, language ability is the cognitive organization of the individuals' concrete experiences with language from which learners inductively learn abstract linguistic knowledge [@Bybee2006; @Lieven2016]. This emphasis on learning from actual language use means that what is acquired is ultimately a reflection of the social contexts in which the learner has been exposed to the language [@Wulff2018; @Beckner2009]. In the concluding chapter research in the usage-based paradigm is discussed both in terms of how the findings of the present dissertation are consistent with these approaches, and how these approaches contribute to a better understanding of L2 acquisition in the immersion context. Specifically, elements of usage-based approaches are used to explain why differences in L2 ability emerge; why they potentially persist in immersion; and finally, how a usage-based theoretical approach can inform immersion pedagogy. 

# Methodology and Individual Studies

<!-- Be very brief but introduce your research goals -->

The main purpose of this dissertation was to identify how the L2 acquisition of immersion learners is impacted by their learning context. This topic is addressed in the studies presented in the following three chapters. Collectively, these studies examine ways in which the L2-English abilities of adolescent L2 learners in immersion are similar or different from the English abilities of community-L2 learners and/or L1-English speakers; how the out-of-school language environments of these immersion learners compare to community-L2 learning peers; and ways in which these differences in L2 learning environment may be associated with identified differences in L2 abilities.


## General Introduction to the Immersion Participants

The central participants of these studies were `r nrow(dataset)` Taiwanese middle-school participants recruited from a single private high school in northern Taiwan, and studying in grade seven, eight, or nine (mean age = `r AgeY` years, `r AgeM` months, *SD* = `r AgeSD` months). These participants spoke Mandarin as their L1, though a few also spoke an additional language, as well. The most common of these was Taiwanese, the local dialect of Min Nan Chinese. These participants had been learning in an immersion context taught by a foreign teacher from an English-speaking country (*e.g.,* the UK, US, Canada, etc.) since preschool (mean age of beginning English immersion = `r AgeoEng`, *SD* = `r AoEsd` months). After preschool, they attended a bilingual elementary school where half their content instruction was in Mandarin from a local teacher, and half in English. On average, they had attended an immersion program for eight years and two months (*SD* = `r yrsImmerSD` months). From the beginning of grade seven their entire school day was in English. Some collected data for individual participants were excluded entirely from analysis for reasons including exposure to English from birth, fewer than five years of immersion exposure (usually transfer-in from an instructed-L2 program), or, in one case, being an outlier for having very low receptive vocabulary. Chapter Two includes two age-matched comparison groups, one of L1-English speakers and the other community-L2 learners. Chapter Three includes the comparison group of L1 speakers. Chapter Four compares the immersion learners and the community-L2 participants. Details for these comparison groups are given in the respective chapters.

## Data Collection Tasks

Each individual study of this dissertation reports the results of a different assessment of L2 ability. To examine morphosyntactic ability, experimental tasks that probed receptive ability with English grammatical morphemes were used in Chapters Two and Three. Both tasks required participants to respond to auditory input and were designed to avoid the influence of metalinguistic L2 knowledge on participant responses. The experiment in Chapter Two was a timed auditory grammaticality judgment task that required participants to decide whether a sentence sounded correct or not. Experimental stimuli for this task included six separate grammatical morphemes. These were articles, regular past tense, plural marking, and three stimulus types that focused on subject-verb agreement: copula or auxiliary [be]{.smallcaps}, auxiliary [do]{.smallcaps} in the form of negative contractions (*i.e.*, *don't* or *doesn't*) and third-person marking (TPM).

Chapter Three reports the results of an experiment that combined visual-world eye-tracking with a picture-decision task. The experiment probed receptive ability with the bound plural-singular marking morpheme '*-s*'. Participants were presented with a four-image visual array and eye movements were tracked online as participants listened to an audio stimulus that included a noun that was marked as either plural or singular. The picture-decision task measured offline comprehension of plural-singular marking. For the critical stimulus nouns, the only disambiguating information was the presence or absence of plural '*-s*'. 

Chapter Four examined the immersion participants' L2 receptive vocabulary. Participants completed the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test [PPVT, @Dunn2007], a standardized assessment of receptive vocabulary normed on monolingual L1-English speakers. The test measures receptive vocabulary breadth by having participants indicate the one of four presented pictures that corresponds to the word spoken by the experimenter. 

In addition to assessments of L2 ability, additional data were collected to understand how participants compared both across study groups, as well as individually, within groups. These data were collected using both a language background questionnaire and additional standardized tests. A version of the Alberta Language Environment Questionnaire-3 [ALEQ-3, @Soto-Corominas2020] was used to collect data for general participant background information and variables expected to be associated with L2 learning context. Some modifications were made from the ALEQ-3, which was designed for use with community-L2 learners, to suit use with immersion learners. Standardized tests included the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing – Non-word repetition sub-test [CTOPP, @Wagner2013] to assess individual participants' verbal memory ability, and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, 2nd Edition, Matrices test [KBIT, @Kaufman2004] to assess nonverbal reasoning. More information about each instrument is provided in the relevant chapters.

## Study One

The main goal of the study presented in Chapter Two was to compare the morphosyntactic ability of immersion learners with community-L2 learners. Existing research supports the expectation that L2 exposure in immersion classrooms results in morphosyntactic abilities that are less target-like than those of community-L2 speakers. However, morphosyntactic ability can vary in either context, and little is known about how these groups compare directly, or how the impact of individual learner factors on L2 morphosyntactic acquisition compares across contexts. To address these gaps, the study presented in Chapter Two compared the ability of early learners of L2 English across these learning contexts. Three groups of adolescent English speakers were compared. These groups were 1) L2 learners who had acquired English as a foreign language in immersion classrooms; 2) L2 learners who had acquired English in community-L2 contexts; and 3) L1-English monolinguals as a control group. Both L2 groups were L1 speakers of Mandarin. Morphosyntactic ability was examined using a grammaticality judgment task examining grammatical morphemes, a feature of English that has been shown to be challenging for speakers of isolating L1s [@Mcdonald2000; @Blom2012]. In addition, this study examined the potential impact of learner factors. The study also examined these grammatical morphemes within syntactic constructions that were expected to differ in relative difficulty. 

This study included two research questions. The first research question examined whether there are differences between each participant group on the experimental task, and whether groups were similarly or differently impacted by stimuli at varying levels of difficulty. Based on prior literature, it was expected that all groups would demonstrate receptive ability indicated as accurate responses on the grammaticality judgment task, but that the control group would be the most accurate, the community-L2 group the next most accurate, and the immersion participants the least accurate. All groups were expected to be more accurate on the easier stimulus items. The second research question examined the impact of learner factors on task accuracy for the two L2 groups. It was expected that learner factors would predict differences within each group. However, it was not assumed that these would be the same for each L2 group, or for both levels of relative construction difficulty.

## Study Two

The main goal of the study presented in Chapter Three was to investigate comprehension of English plural-singular marking by a group of L2-English immersion learners whose L1 is Mandarin. The study compared adolescent immersion learners with age-matched participants who spoke English as their L1. This study employed a visual-world eye-tracking task measuring online comprehension combined with a picture decision task reflecting accuracy of sentence interpretation. 

The data from this task was used to examine two research questions. The first research question examined whether the adolescent immersion learners were similar to the age-matched L1-English group in offline interpretations of the stimuli as measured by picture-decision task responses. The expectation based on prior research was that the immersion group's responses would be less accurate than those of the L1-English group. The second research question examined online comprehension of plural-singular marking as measured by eye-tracking. Eye-tracking allowed for the proportion of looks to target images to be compared across groups. Like the first research question, it was expected that immersion learners would show less sensitivity to plural-singular marking as demonstrated by fewer and later looks to target images.

## Study Three

Chapter Four reports on a study that examined how the out-of-school L2 learning environments of the adolescent immersion learners differ from those of a group of community-L2 learners, and how this impacts L2 receptive vocabulary ability. It has long been considered typical of immersion contexts that learners' L2 exposure is limited to the classroom [@Swain1997]. However, there is little research that probes how out-of-school L2 experience impacts immersion learners' L2 abilities. In addition, it is unclear whether widespread access to the Internet provides immersion learners with new and beneficial L2 experiences. 

This study had three research aims. The first was to examine how L2 experiences outside of school compare for adolescent L2 learners in either a community-L2 context or an immersion context. The second aim was to see if the L2 receptive vocabulary ability of participants differed across the two contexts. The third aim was to connect the L2 experiences of learners within each context to L2 receptive vocabulary ability. This was done by modelling learner-external factors related to learners' L2 learning environments as potential predictors of individual differences in L2 receptive vocabulary. Data collected learner-external sources of out-of-school L2 experiences were categorized depending on whether they could be categorized as opportunities for additional L2 input, or whether they were more balanced in opportunities for both L2 input and L2 output. This distinction was motivated given that immersion learners' in-school L2 experience has been shown to be predominantly L2 input with few opportunities to produce L2 output [@Swain1988; @Allen1990]. Given that the immersion learners are foreign language learners, the groups were expected to be different in that the immersion learners would have fewer opportunities for either L2 input or use, and that these diminished opportunities would also be associated with lower receptive vocabulary scores. However, it was also expected that both an impact of greater out-of-school L2 exposure would predict higher vocabulary scores for participants of either group.
