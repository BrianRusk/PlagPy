# Best Practices for Using Python with RStudio Connect

ln -s -f /Users/brian/Library/r-miniconda/bin/python /Users/brian/anaconda3/bin/python

The -s tells to create a symbolic link.

If your file path contains spaces or other special characters, you’ll need to enclose it in quotation marks. So, if you wanted to create a link on your desktop to a folder named “My Files” inside your user directory, you’d need something like the following command:

ln -s "/Users/name/My Files" "/Users/name/Desktop/My Link"

/Users/brian/Library/r-miniconda/bin/activate

brew link python@3.9

conda install anaconda=

conda update --all
